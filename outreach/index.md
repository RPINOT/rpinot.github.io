# Outreach Activities

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
In a field as strategic and high-profile as AI, I believe it is vital for researchers 
not only to explain their results within their community, but also to help increase 
public awareness of the challenges and stakes of new technologies. I also think 
it is imperative to continue highlighting the social, economic and environmental 
impact of AI algorithms. That is why I am helping to raise awareness on the security 
issues of AI algorithms by taking part in several outreach activities. Below you will find a list 
presenting some of them.
