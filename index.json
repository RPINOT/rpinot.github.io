I also think it is imperative to continue highlighting the social, economic and environmental impact of AI algorithms. That is why I am helping to raise awareness on the security issues of AI algorithms by taking part in several outreach activities. Below you will find a list presenting some of them.

Most of my work has a theoretical flavor, but I also like to work on more applied projects to get deeper understanding of state-of-the-art methods, or simply to better grasp the gap that can exist between the theoretical analysis and the empirical performance of some machine learning algorithms. Below you will find a list of my published work in books, journals and conferences. For a full (up to date) list of my work, please visit my google scholar.
