# Teaching 
<br>

  
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
 teach in both the Computer Science and Mathematics departments, primarily 
 focusing on the fundamentals of machine learning and data analysis. Additionally, 
 I occasionally deliver guest lectures in Master and PhD programs as well as
 at summer/winter schools. Below, you will find a list of my teaching activities.
