<div style="text-align: justify"> 
My main line of research is in <b> statistical machine learning </b> with a focus on the 
<b> privacy and robustness </b> of machine learning algorithms. Most of my work has a theoretical 
flavor, but I also like to work on more applied projects to get deeper understanding
of state-of-the-art methods, or simply to better grasp the gap that can exist between the
theoretical analysis and the empirical performance of some machine learning algorithms. 
Below you will find a list of my published work in books, journals and conferences.
